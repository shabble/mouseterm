Todo list for MouseTerm.
------------------------

* Configuration
** Add a config file (probably a plist) into the bundle that controls
   the various settings.
* Parsing
** Maybe generalise the parser based on [[http://vt100.net/emu/vt500_parser.png]]
** add a general method for consuming events so that they are not passed to
   the Terminal VT100 parser.
* Mouse options
** support the other modes listed in [[http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html][XTerm escape reference]]
   Specifically:
   - CSI ? 9 h
   - CSI ? 100 [0123] h
    - 1003 (All-motion tracking) is probably unnecessary
   and pass through button events and positions correctly.
* Other features
** Tidy up the code for handling custom tab titles
*** try to figure out why setScriptCustomTitle forces a redraw, but setCustomTitle doesn't.
** Look into the difficulty of supporting 256-colour mode
*** probably very hard. Even TerminalColors only allows remapping of the standard ANSI set.
** Add configurable logging support
*** Compile time or run-time?
*** Maybe support CSI ? 46 [hl] (DECSET Logging)
**** Where to?
* Compatibility
** Get a copy of Snow Leopard, or find someone who does to test.
** Try to merge Brodie's upstream fixes in again.
